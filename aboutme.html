        <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>
                My name is Jack Zamary, and I am a student at the College of William & Mary pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Data Science with a concentration in Spatial Data Analytics and a minor in Biology. Through my coursework and research, I’ve built a strong foundation in GIS analysis, remote sensing, and environmental science.

        <div class="about-section">
            <p>
                I’m passionate about leveraging spatial data to better understand ecological systems and support sustainable solutions to real-world challenges. My projects include mapping harmful algal blooms in Alaska with the Google Earth Engine API and collaborating with the Keck Environmental Field Lab to analyze shoreline habitats and their impact on local species.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>
                I enjoy working across disciplines to turn complex data into digestible, actionable insights. Outside of academics, you’ll often find me running, cycling, or hiking with friends. Looking ahead, I’m excited to explore opportunities at the intersection of data science, environmental research, and community impact, whether through conservation work, urban planning, or applied geospatial technologies.
