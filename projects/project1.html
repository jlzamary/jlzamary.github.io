      <!-- Paragraph 1 about the topic -->
      Climate change is reshaping Alaska’s fragile ecosystems, with warming weather driving seasonal shifts that threaten coastal habitats. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) leads the Chukchi Sea Coastal Lagoon Monitoring project to provide insights that support researchers, conservationists, and local communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Paragraph 2 about the topic -->
      As a research analyst with William & Mary’s Institute for Integrative Conservation (IIC), I collaborated with WCS to study ice coverage, lagoon connectivity, and algal growth across 26 lagoons in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Our goal was to develop an interactive ArcGIS Experience Builder application that enables fishers and conservation experts to track habitat changes and identify long-term trends through accessible spatial data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Paragraph 3 about the topic -->
      Drawing on my background in biology and environmental science, I developed a Python workflow using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) API to process satellite imagery. I applied the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to delineate lagoon bodies and calculated the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) from Sentinel-2 bands to assess algal blooms. NDCI values were scaled from –0.2 to 0.8 and visualized with a blue-to-red gradient to indicate bloom severity. Time-series datasets were exported as CSVs for WCS analysis, while selected satellite images were processed as GeoTIFFs for further work in ArcPro.

      <!-- Paragraph 4 about the topic -->
      As of September 2025, the project is ongoing. The satellite-derived datasets and interactive mapping tools provide critical resources for monitoring ecosystem health and informing conservation strategies in Arctic lagoons.
