    <!-- first background paragraph -->
   For the past century, jackalopes have been hunted to near extinction due to the unique material of their antlers, their milk, and their aggressiveness. The species has recently been added to the Red List of Threatened Species, and measures must be taken to protect them. GIS students at William & Mary have been selected to work alongside professionals in Wyoming to map Jackalope habitats and determine where they should be protected to preserve this unique species for generations to come.

    <!-- second background paragraph -->
    The high demands for the Jackalope's natural features, including its milk and antlers, have put the species at risk of extinction. It has been deemed important by Wyoming conservationists and state officials to find land that best suits the Jackalopes living styles and grant it protection under State Code 23-1-102 (Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Protection Act) in hopes of ensuring this native Wyoming species can thrive.

  <!-- Project Conclusion and Policy Recommendations -->
  <h2 class="section-title">Project Conclusion and Policy Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- conclusion and recommendations paragraph -->
    Locations that would be best suited to be protected under State Code 23-1-102 would be areas represented in dark green on the eastern part of the state. A location here provides jackalopes with shrubland to forage, located in counties with high alcohol arrest rates (for access to whiskey), high lightning pulse detection (for ample mating opportunity), and a safe distance from roads to minimize dangers. We strongly suggest that local officials consider some area in this land to protect the natural phenomena that is the jackalope and keep Wyoming a Wyld state with wild creatures for future generations to ponder about.
